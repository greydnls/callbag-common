# callbag-common

Commonly used [callbags](https://github.com/callbag/callbag).

npm i callbag-common
```

Included callbags:

- `pipe()`
- `of()`
- `fromPromise()`
- `fromEvent()`
- `map()`
- `filter()`
- `interval()`
- `merge()`
- `combine()`
- `expr()`
- `flatten()`
- `debounce()`
- `tap()`
- `subscribe()`

## Why?

[callbag-basics](https://github.com/staltz/callbag-basics) is maintained _relatively_ slowly, specifically due to the fragmantation
of both utilities included and export targets (for example `tap()` is missing since it lacks types, or examples 
on the README are not working due to environment differences).

In callbag-commons, on the other hand:

- Callbags are picked based on active usage in real-life projects.
- Specifically targeting TypeScript / ES6 (no pre-bundled version as that means no tree-shaking).
- External libraries used, whenever possible.
- Internal alternatives used, whenever external library not possible.

So ideally, in the long run, this should be not _much_ different from callbag-basics. It will basically be
_eventually decentralized_ and _always available_ (everything working in target environments properly).

ðŸ‘‰ TODO: add usage docs / examples for all included callbags. Generally this repo can be a nice _starter pack_ for callbags.
