# ðŸŽ’ callbag-common

A collection of commonly used reactive utilities that comply with the [callbag specification](https://github.com/callbag/callbag).
```bash
npm i callbag-common
```

<br>

ðŸ‘‰ If you do not know what reactive stream programming is or what callbags are, [read this post first](/what-are-callbags).

## Example Usage

**STEP 1**: create a source using a [source factory](#source-factories):

```ts
import { interval } from 'callbag-common';

const source = interval(1000) // --> emit every second
```

<br>

**STEP 2**: transform your sources by [piping](/util/pipe) them into some [operators](#operators):
```ts
import { pipe, interval, map, filter } from 'callbag-common';

const source = interval(1000) // --> emit every second
pipe(
  source,
  map(x => x * 3),            // --> multipy by 3
  filter(x => x % 2),         // --> only allow odd numbers
)
```

<br>

**STEP 3**: [subscribe](/util/subscribe) to your transformed source:
```ts | --term â€‹
import { interval, pipe, map, filter, subscribe } from 'callbag-common'

const source = interval(1000) // --> emits every second
pipe(
  source,
  map(x => x * 3),            // --> multiply by 3
  filter(x => x % 2),         // --> only allow odd numbers
  subscribe(console.log)      // --> log any incoming number
)

## Included Utilities

### Source Factories

- [of](/factory/of): Convert static value(s) to a callbag.
- [fromEvent](/factory/from-event): Listen to DOM event.
- [fromPromise](/factory/from-promise): Converts a promise to a callbag.
- [interval](/factory/interval): Emits an increasing number at given intervals.

### Operators

- [map](/operator/map): Transforms incoming values.
- [filter](/operator/filter): Filters incoming values.
- [flatten](/operator/flatten): Flattens higher-order callbags.
- [debounce](/operator/debounce): Debounces incoming values.

### Comination

- [expr](/combine/expr): Create expressions from other callbags.
- [merge](/combine/merge): Merges given callbags, emitting when each one emits.
- [combine](/combine/combine): Combines given callbags, emits arrays of latest values of each.

### Utilities

- [pipe](/util/pipe): Pipes sources to operators to sinks.
- [subscribe](/util/subscribe): Subscribes to given callbag.
- [tap](/util/tap): Taps into given callbag (without subscribing).

## Why Callbags?

- They are [pretty fast](https://github.com/staltz/callbag-basics/tree/master/perf)
- They are light-weight (this library is [~1.8kB total](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=callbag-common@0.1.0))
- They are simple and predictable
- They work seamlessly for iterable programming

## Why a Collection?

A key aspect of callbag spec is its simplicity, which makes tools and utilities built around it
[pretty simple as well](https://github.com/callbag/callbag/blob/master/getting-started.md).
Maintaining each of these tools independently is much easier and results in overal faster iteration
and higher quality of the whole ecosystem.

However discovering and using necessary tools becomes more difficult. The
[callbag wiki](https://github.com/callbag/callbag/wiki) acts as a good reference, but
it can be daunting for new-comers to go through it and find what they need.

Additionally, importing from multiple libraries reduces code readability:

```ts
import pipe from 'callbag-pipe'
import subscribe from 'callbag-subscribe';
import map from 'callbag-map';
import filter from 'callbag-filter';
import flatten from 'callbag-flatten';
```

<br>

With a collection solves these issues, as discovery of basic utilities (or utilities for a specific
purpose) is already done by collection maintainers and imports become much easier as well:

```ts
import { pipe, subscribe, map, filter, flatten } from 'callbag-common';
```

## Why this Collection?

A strict collection can only be as agile as its least agile module.
callbag-common, on the other hand:

- Provides external libraries, whenever possible.
- Provides internal stand-ins, whenever external counterparts are slow to catch up on their issues.

Additionally, it specifically targets TypeScript / ES6, and only includes callbags that are
commonly used in real-life projects. This means while it gets all the benefits of a decentralized eco-system,
it also always guarantees functionality and type safety.
